# Design-Verification-of-a-DSP48A1-Slice
This repository contains the Verilog HDL design and a comprehensive testbench for the DSP48A1 slice of the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.  The project showcases a complete design and verification flow using QuestaSim for simulation and Vivado for synthesis and implementation. It includes the RTL and a self-checking testbench.
